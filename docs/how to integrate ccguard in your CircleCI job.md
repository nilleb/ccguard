# How to integrate ccguard in your CircleCI job

## Limitations

At the moment, [CircleCI does not expose the base branch of the PR being processed](https://ideas.circleci.com/ideas/CCI-I-894).
ccguard assumes then that the base branch is `origin/master`, and determines which reference to use on the base of the common history between `HEAD` and `origin/master`.
As pointed out by a comment on the Idea, a transitory solution would be to use [this orb](https://github.com/NarrativeScience/circleci-orb-ghpr), specifying `--target-branch ${GITHUB_PR_BASE_BRANCH:-origin/master}`. The two sample workflows include it.
Otherwise, you could adopt a more aggressive behavior `--target-branch HEAD` that compares the current CC to the previous commit.

## Common

Set two environment variables

```sh
# the public address of your ccguard server
CCGUARD_SERVER_ADDRESS=https://ccguard.your.domain
# you should have setup this same token when preparing ccguard_server
CCGUARD_TOKEN=azoudcodbqzypfuazÃªofvpzkecnaio
```

## Go workflow

```yaml
  prepare_tests:
    description: "Prepare unit tests environment"
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Prepare unit tests environment
          command: |
            go get github.com/t-yuki/gocover-cobertura
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv python3-wheel
            python3 -m venv /tmp/workspace/env --system-site-packages
            /tmp/workspace/env/bin/pip install ccguard
      - persist_to_workspace:
          root: /tmp/workspace
          paths:
              - env
  run_tests:
    description: "Run unit tests and compute code coverage"
    steps:
      - attach_workspace:
          at: /tmp/workspace
      - run:
          name: Run unit tests
          command: |
            GO111MODULE=on go test -coverprofile coverage.txt -covermode=count -coverpkg=github.com/nilleb/fsevents/... ./...
            ccguard_convert coverage.txt -if go -of xml -o coverage.xml
            source /tmp/workspace/env/bin/activate
            ccguard --adapter web coverage.xml --target-branch ${GITHUB_PR_BASE_BRANCH:-origin/master}

      - store_artifacts:
          path: cc.html
          destination: cc.html

      - store_artifacts:
          path: diff.html
          destination: diff.html
```

## python workflow

```yaml
      - run:
          name: run build workflow
          command: |
            python3 -m venv venv
            . venv/bin/activate
            pip install black flake8 pytest pytest-cov ccguard
            venv/bin/black --check ccguard/*.py
            venv/bin/flake8 ccguard/*.py
            venv/bin/pytest --cov-report xml --cov ccguard
            venv/bin/python ccguard/ccguard.py --html coverage.xml --adapter web --target-branch ${GITHUB_PR_BASE_BRANCH:-origin/master}

      - store_artifacts:
          path: cc.html
          destination: cc.html

      - store_artifacts:
          path: diff.html
          destination: diff.html
```
